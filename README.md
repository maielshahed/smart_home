small idea about the smart home using ATmega32 microcontroller

First, we register a password to enter the house and store it EEPROM

As well as a password to log out of the house EEPROM

Second, for example, we have two rooms:

The house displays some of our services in the rooms such as

- Lighting the lights
- Operating the air conditioners

We can do a lot

Through it keypad

We can light the lights in the rooms or operate the air conditioners by pressing some buttons

We can also control their closure in a forced manner if we want

In the event of leaving the house
We can control the closure of everything that is in the house


This project contains multiple hardware items, including an ATmega32 microcontroller, LCD, , and servo moto,keypad
